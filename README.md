# Face-Recognition-Using-OpenCv
## Introduction
- This repository contains a Python script for face recognition using Haar Cascade classifiers and Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH). The script detects faces in images using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier and then recognizes the faces using a pre-trained LBPH face recognizer.

## Features
- Detect faces in images using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- Recognize faces using LBPH face recognizer.
- Annotate detected faces with labels and confidence scores.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.x recommended)
- pip (Python package installer)

 ## Usage
- Ensure you have the Haar Cascade XML file (haar_face.xml) and the pre-trained face recognizer model (face_trained.yml).
- Place the images you want to recognize in the specified directory.
- Run the script using Python:
